# Death Stranding 2 Blood Boomerang

## 3D Printing

### Files

There are two files for 3D Printing:

- [DeathStranding_BloodBoomerang_Assembled.step](DeathStranding_BloodBoomerang_Assembled.step)
  - This file contains all the printable parts in the correct locations but will require splitting and adjustment to be printable
- [DeathStranding_BloodBoomerang_Pre-layout.3mf](DeathStranding_BloodBoomerang_Pre-layout.3mf)
  - This file has the parts layed out to fit a 256x256 build plate, sufficiently spaced out to allow for brims where needed. The blade has also been split down the middle to make it easier to print. If you have a resin printer or are willing to put up with slightly worse surface finish, use the blade model from the assembled file.

### Recommended settings

I heavily recommend using adaptive layer heights on all parts and setting to the highest quality. The surfaces of the blade and handle plates are sloped and thinner layers give you a better finish requiring less sanding.

The 4 pins are identical in diameter and length.

If you have issues printing parts like the blade, piston shaft, or hinge - split the parts down the middle to give your printer a slightly better chance rather than trying to print the fine details with a large nozzle. Or just use a smaller nozzle :)

## BOM

### Printed parts

All parts within each file (.step or .stl) are to be printed. As mentioned above, the 4 cylindrical pins are identical,so if one fails, feel free to reprint any of them.

### Additional hardware

A few non-printed parts are required:

- 2 x M2x10mm countersunk screws
- 3 x M2x6mm countersunk screws
- 2 x M2x2mmx3.2mm threaded inserts
- 1 x 4mmx45mm spring
  - This can be replaced with any combination of shorter springs or possibly longer springs so long as the fully compressed spring is shorter than around 40mm to still retain some action in the piston
- Small rubber band
  - Something like the bands used for braces. The groove is 0.8mm wide, so a band thinner than that would be desired.
  - Preferably around 12mm in diameter, but the band can be stretched if it's too small or doubled up if it's too long.

## Assembly

### Video

A step-by-step assembly video is embedded above (yes, I went through the effort of animating and building shaders for that. Yes the rubber band is shape-keyed. Yes the threads are modeled with correct major and minor diameters on the screws and inserts. I don't have a problem; I can stop any time I want).

### Text instructions

1. Set the inserts into the back plate.
   - This is the plate which has slightly larger holes near the top. Make sure the inserts are flush on the inside and the outside.
2. Glue the four pins in place

   - Do your best to keep them perfectly perpendicular to the plate and fully seated in their bosses. I recommend having the top plate ready to hold in place (use the spacer and the 10mm bolts to align the two) while the glue cures.
   - When attaching the pins, I would only glue them in to one side so you can still separate the boomerang later if something needs tweaking (replacing the rubber band if it snaps for example).

3. Glue the blood port (I'm assuming that's what it is, idk) onto the back plate within the faint outlines on the inside.

4. Set the latch in place on its pin

5. Stretch the rubber band around the pins on the latch and the blood port.

   - This can be a bit tricky. Try to fish the rubber band through the same way you would when flossing your teeth (10/10 doctors recommend flossing, btw)

6. Set that assembly aside for a moment

7. Grab the hinge and the blade and attach them with an M2x6mm screw

   - Use the hole near the back of the blade, not the one close to the point
   - Be sure to set the screw fully within the countersink. You may need to clean up the countersink to do so if your part has any stringing.
   - The holes on the other side of the hinge are slightly undersized so they may need a bit of force to tap the threads. Be patient and gentle, the walls are very thin

8. Install the piston case in the same way. M2x6mm screw, all the way into the countersink.

   - If you want, you can glue the screws in place, the blade and piston case holes are slightly oversized to give a mostly free spin with a touch of tension

9. Slide the spring(s) into the case

10. Slide the piston shaft into the case

11. Align the hole on the shaft (there is a correct side with a countersink, make sure it is facing up) with the blade and screw it in with the last M2x6mm screw

12. Bring the blade assembly over to the body assembly from earlier

13. Push the M2x10mm screws through the front plate, adding the spacer to the screw on the back edge.

14. Pass the 10mm screws through the hinge and past the latch (make sure the latch is pulled back a little so the spacer sits in its inner corner) and tighten them down.

15. Adjust the tension on the hinge screw to give a smooth movement of the hinge. Too tight and it'll be difficult to move; too loose and it will just flop open.

16. You're done! Enjoy your new Blood Boomerang and "Keep on Keeping On", Porter :thumbsup:
